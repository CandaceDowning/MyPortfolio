          <p>
            With a Bachelor's of Fine Arts, an Associates of Science, and an
            American Board Of Opticianry certification, it is safe to say that I
            love to learn! My fine arts background leads me to be enthusiastic
            about front-end and design work, but I will always jump on the
            opportunity to learn and do new things.
